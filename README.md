# C++ playground
Playground environment for one-offs as I learn C++

Examples likely original from:

- Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup
- Learn C The Hard Way by Zed Shaw
- Past experience in other languages

## Getting Started
To run one of our programs, run the following steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/twolfson/cpp-playground
cd cpp-playground

# Run the appropriate `run.sh`
#   This will compile `main.cpp` and run `main.out`
./01-hello-world/run.sh
# Hello, World!
```

## Concepts to implement/explore
We've done most of these in JS/Python but reapplying them in C++ should hammer new concepts like pointers home:

- [x] Structs (already did a little but want more formal definitions)
- [ ] Nested arrays (or 1 dimensional strided arrays)
- [ ] Data structures (e.g. linked list, stack, queue, tree, heap)
- [ ] Search algorithms (e.g. linear, binary search)
- [ ] Sort algorithms (e.g. quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sort)
- [ ] Linting and style checking
- [ ] Testing and CI
- [ ] Explore when variables get cleaned out of scope and as a result destructed (if ever)
- [ ] Threads
- [ ] Explore linter for explicit includes (e.g. comment based, namespaced, something else)
- [ ] Reading/writing to a file
- [ ] Random numbers
